## How to start the app

This repo contains the full stack app - a React app and a json-server to store the data.

### Starting the Frontend

```
npm run start
```

### Starting the Backend

```
npm run jserver
```

## Starting point

The starting point of this exercise is a React app that renders a list of posts. Posts are stored in the "JSON DB" in the backend, and served by `json-server`. The posts are fetched and rendered, and the user can add a new post, edit a post and delete a post.

All of this is done with a regular fetch, wrapped in an `postApi.tsx` file that only exports the methods needed for that CRUD.
